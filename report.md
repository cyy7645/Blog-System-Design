## 1. How to run the project

the mysql services and mongodb service as well as elastic serach were already started, so just run the project.

- cd to your folder  
- enter in your shell to connet our AWS server  
```ssh -i "newspark.pem" ubuntu@ec2-18-224-37-59.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com```

```cd blog-role_ok```
